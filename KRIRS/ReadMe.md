# Year 12 Thesis Project: KRIRS (Key Result Indicator Report Software)

This is the Thesis Project (and Paper) that I have submitted for my High School. I was a STEM student and most people have chosen to do somewhere in the medical field. I thought that I would do something different. Primarily, because I love programming.

Note: I would only be showcasing the software I made, and not the paper.
