# Year 12 Thesis Project
#### KRIRS (Key Result Indicator* Report Software)</br>
\*[meaning](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/key-results-indicator-KRI): A key result indicator (KRI) is a metric that measures the quantitative results of business actions to help companies track progress and reach organizational goals.

This is the Thesis Project (and Paper) that I have submitted for my High School. I was a STEM student and most people have only dedicated their work to the medical field. I thought that I would do something different. Primarily, because I love programming.

Note: I would only be showcasing the software I made, and not the paper.</br>
Also that, this is the work of a 12th Grade student. ~~I had a crashcourse for SQL and C#. On the spot.~~


Here's the snippet of my paper to capture the gist of my project's purpose to give it meaning to you, without it being too overboard (omitted some texts):

##### Statement of the Problem
The fundamental problem in the current system’s manual processes (is that the School) uses the manual record-keeping system. It wastes a lot of paper, pens, toner and ink cartridges, and money. Generating the Key Result Indicators involves over complicated steps of receiving, inputting, and passing of data. This system is very labour intensive, does not certify that the data is always accurate, and has delayed delivery of the monthly results. This brings forth unneeded repetition of verification that can be enhanced with a simpler, more effective system.

~~TL/DR: If it can be automated or use a software for that work to make your lives easier, why not make use of that??~~

The Key Result Indicators Report Software goals would include:</br>
  1. an instantaneous report for a monthly basis.</br>
  2. a collaborated exchange of data between the Deputy Principal's Office and each class of Grade 12 STEM strand.</br>
  3. a straightforward Key Result Indicators report.</br>

##### Scope and Limitation
This study is restricted to only the two sections of Grade 12 STEM: Grade 12 Initiative (STEM A) and Grade 12 Grit (STEM B) for the Academic Year 2018 to 2019 and is exclusively made for (the School). It focuses on the area of Computer Science specifically under Software Engineering and uses Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2017, an Integrated Development Environment, to design the software product and Microsoft SQL Server Express 2017, the Key Result Indicators Report Software server in ties with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2017, a visual database design tool, to manage the database.</br>
  One of the greatest limitations of this study was the amount of time the researcher had to produce the functional software. The researcher only had two weeks to be able to create a piece of functional software, to which afterwards have the ability to use and apply said software by management.

##### Summary
This study wanted to find out whether creating a report software will help improve (the School) from following the traditional manual system to compute for the Key Result Indicators. The Key Result Indicators Report Software focuses on verified data and collaboration to generate reports for the computation of the Key Result Indicators. This study begins from knowing the problem of the existing system and planning how the proposed system could implement a better version of the existing system through additional features. 

Then, the process of software design begins by:</br>
   1. Detailed Design: initial designing of flowcharts of the existing system, proposed system and, data flow diagrams;</br>
   2. Architectural Design: refining the design of the database through Microsoft SQL Server Express 2017 and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2017; and</br>
   3. External Design: designing the graphical user interface through Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2017.</br>
   Lastly, the software product is deployed and will go through the acceptance phase by the customer’s end. The data is analysed through developing the software and meeting its software goals.

##### Conclusions
Based on the major findings, the following are concluded:</br>
  1. The software successfully generates an instantaneous straightforward report.</br>
  2. Designating one main flow of data allows collaboration and reduces extended effort.</br>
  3. The report software encourages to discontinue the extended use of materials.</br>
  4. Data inputs are verified for honest data.</br>
