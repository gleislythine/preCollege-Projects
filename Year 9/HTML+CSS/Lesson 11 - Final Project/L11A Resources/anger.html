<h1>Anger Core</h1>
<p>
The Anger Core is a personality core that appears in Portal.
<br>
<br>
It is one of the cores Chell knocks off of GLaDOS during the climactic "battle" at the end of the game. It was later destroyed in an Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.
<br>
<br>
The Anger Core is quite literally a sphere of fury. It lacks the ability to speak, instead resorting to making animalistic roars, snarls, and growls.
<br>
<br>
The Anger Core is voiced by Mike Patton.
