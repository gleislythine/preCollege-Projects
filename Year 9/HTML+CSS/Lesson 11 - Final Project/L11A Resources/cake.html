<p>
The Intelligence Core, also referred to as the Logic Core or Cake Core, is a personality core that appears in Portal.
<br>
<br>
It is one of the cores Chell knocks off of GLaDOS during the climactic "battle" at the end of the game. It was later destroyed in an Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.
<br>
<br>
The Intelligence Core speaks in a slow, monotonous voice, and spends its time reciting a cake recipe, which often has unusual or potentially lethal ingredients. As it speaks, it will roll lazily around, seemingly entranced in recipe recitation.
<br>
<br>
The Intelligence Core is voiced by Ellen McLain.
