<p>
The Curiosity Core is a personality core that appears in Portal.
<br>
<br>
It is one of the cores Chell knocks off of GLaDOS during the climactic "battle" at the end of the game. It was later destroyed in an Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.
<br>
<br>
The Curiosity Core is an inquisitive, active chatterbox that speaks with a high-pitched, almost child-like, voice. The Curiosity Core is voiced by Ellen McLain.
<br>
<br>
Prior to the release of Portal 2, the Curiosity Core's model was used as a stand-in for the unused Hover Turret.
