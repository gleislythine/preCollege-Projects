<h1> Meet the Cores! </h1>
<p>
	Cores (also referred to as Spheres, Personality Cores/Spheres, or Aperture Science Artificial Personality Constructs) are machines designed to house advanced artificial intelligence, mostly unique for their ability to express emotions. Cores generally come in two varieties: Spherical and Input. Spheres are the standard form, used for android bodies (such as Atlas) and other purposes. Input Cores are eliptical Cores such as are used in Turrets or P-Body.
<br>
<br>
Each unique core is either integrated into a robotic body or left in standalone sphere form. (these spheres are usually attached to management rails) in the Aperture Science computer-aided Enrichment Center, such as the Turrets, Atlas, and P-body.
<br>
<br>
The raw spherical appearance of the cores are heavily featured throughout the finale events of both Portal and the single-player campaign in Portal 2.
<br>
<br>
Developed by Aperture Science technicians, GLaDOS is the earliest known personality core - specifically designed for becoming the Enrichment Center's overseer. The next cores developed were given the purpose of counteracting GLaDOS' psychotic behavior (such as flooding test chambers and other vital parts of the facility with neurotoxin) by integrating with her (sub)concious and altering her personality.
<br>
<br>
Often present in the form of spherical shapes, these cores are a more simplistic design as their purpose had been more at hand instead. This contrasts with the majority of the designs of Aperture androids in the Enrichment Center that are personality core-based such as Atlas (enclosed core design), P-body (core inputs), and Turrets (also core inputs).
<br>
<br>
After the events of Portal, it became apparent that some of the unused (deactivated) cores kept in storage have been automatically reactivated by the facility to maintain the Enrichment Center. Under extreme circumstances/time, these cores have been unable to compensate, and have failed to do so. Some cores become corrupted (the cause of this is unknown).
<br>
<br>
As the name implies, each core has its own unique personality and behavior, which can be incorporated into the central core when they are physically attached to it. However, most cores were unneeded and deactivated. These were later reactivated after the destruction of GLaDOS in Portal.
<br>
<br>
During the conflict with GLaDOS in Portal, whenever Chell would drop a personality core into the incinerator, not only did GLaDOS experience pain when they are destroyed, she also began to lose some of her reinforced prominent personality traits. These include as her references to cake, and her moral values, which resulted in a much stronger desire to kill Chell.
