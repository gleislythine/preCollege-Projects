<p>
The Morality Core is a personality core that appears in Portal, and Portal 2: Lab Rat. It is one of many cores that was attached to GLaDOS in order to regulate her behavior. It was programmed to prevent her from doing unethical deeds, acting as an artificial conscience. When Doug Rattmann first sees the Morality Core, he doubts its capability to restrain GLaDOS, saying "You can always ignore your conscience". He turns out to be correct, as despite the Morality Core being attached, GLaDOS floods Aperture with neurotoxin anyway.
<br>
<br>
At the end of Portal, it falls off of GLaDOS' body, possibly intentionally. GLaDOS repeatedly tells Chell not to touch it, but she disregards this advice and destroys it in an Emergency Intelligence Incinerator. With her conscience removed, GLaDOS is free to flood her chamber with neurotoxin. However, the Morality Core was apparently also necessary for keeping the Rocket Turret in her chamber deactivated. Chell uses this turret to destroy GLaDOS.
