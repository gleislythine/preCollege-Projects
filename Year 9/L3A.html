<p class="column">
I spent most of my high school years in a Christian school. We had Bible class every day and over the course of my years in school we studied most of the books in the Old and New Testament. However, I don't ever remember my Bible teacher mentioning <span class="r">Ecclesiastes 1:18</span> to me. It's not hard to see why I suppose. This verse seems to fly in the face of what most of school is about. I did learn that Ecclesiastes was most likely written by <span class="r">King Solomon</span> who the Bible refers to as the wisest man in the Bible. So it stands to reason that my teachers did not want to spend a lot of time on a verse in the Bible written by the wisest man in the Bible that says that all this knowledge and wisdom they were imparting to me in school would only lead to sorrow and grief. Now that I'm older and wiser I think I know what Solomon was trying to tell us. I think it would help us later in life when we discover that all the earthly knowledge we fretted over so much in high school and beyond isn't really that much help when facing the toughest things in life.
<br><br>
When I was in high school I had this vague feeling that all this knowledge, skills and understanding that I was gaining in class was more or less reliable and to a certain extent complete. I assumed that someone out there had figured it out and humanity had arrived at the answer and that was why it was now being taught to me in school. The teachers seemed so confident of their information and knowledge.
<br><br>
In general schools and teachers give their students that feeling that this information and material they are teaching has allowed the world and it's people to find a good foundation for a healthy society. All the incentive (<span class="r">i.e. grades, rewards...</span>) was put on understanding the information as thoroughly as possible so we could be successful in life. Even though you don't achieve mastery in anything in high school there is a certain assumption that someone somewhere has and if you work hard then you can too and then everything will be good.
<br><br>
You don't have to live very long after high school to begin to question the validity and lasting value of the information and knowledge that was so painstakingly taught you by your dedicated high school teachers. The older you get the more clearly you begin to see that the world is a mess and the knowledge and information you were taught in high school hasn't really fixed anything. Not only is the world is a mess but many of the things I was taught have now either changed or been proven wrong by some scientist somewhere. I realize now that much of what I was taught in high school was only partially correct at best. And some of what I worked so hard to understand has been completely discarded as bad information. It gets worse. There is an old saying that goes something like this - <span class="r">"the more you know, the more you realize how little you or anybody knows."</span> Now that I'm older and have acquired a fair bit of knowledge I'm pretty sure that statement is true.
<br><br>
So it stands to reason that the smartest, wisest most knowledgeable people would also be the people who also know most completely how little humanity really knows and how far away we truly are from really solving any of life's toughest problems with our human knowledge and wisdom. And that is why Solomon, the wisest man in the Bible would say <span>"For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief."</span>. As the wisest man in the Bible no one would know more thoroughly than him the futility of his knowledge and wisdom.
<br><br>
Even though Solomon is called the wisest man in the Bible he still went through a period of time in his life when he got caught up in the world and its temptations. He was the <span class="r">wealthiest and most powerful man on earth</span> and therefore in old age and eventually death he had a lot to lose. He searched in vain for some knowledge or information or understanding that would prolong his wealth and power or at least seal his legacy in some tangible way. In the end his wisdom lead him to realize that nothing he knew or had done was going to save him in any kind of a meaningful way. He was going to die just like everyone else. <span class="r">All his knowledge, wisdom and understanding ended in the sorrow of inevitable death.</span> The good news is that Solomon returns to god in the end. I believe Solomon finally learned to trust God again late in his life the way he had in his early years. And this is what you should do as well.
<br><br>
When you begin to realize that all this knowledge and information you are acquiring is not going to save you any more than it saved Solomon I hope you will realize that the only wise path left is the one where you trust God <span class="r">"And the peace of God, which <b><u>transcends all understanding</u></b>, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." Phil. 4:7.</span>
<br><br>
I'm not saving you should give up on school and quit trying to do your best. You will need an education if you want to get a job in this life. And unless you are already independently wealthy you are going to need a job. But don't expect too much from the worldly knowledge you are acquiring in your high school and post high school education. It won't save you any more than it saved Solomon.
