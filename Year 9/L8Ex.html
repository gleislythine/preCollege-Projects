<h2>The Problem of the Lack of Statistical Possibility for First Life and for Darwinian Evolution</h2>
<div class="column">
<b>This is an excerpt from an article by Asher Norman titled <u>Evolution from a Jewish Perspective</u>.</b>
<br><br>
<i><b>Note:</b> Asher (Roland) Norman is an author, attorney, and Orthodox Jew, living in California. He also lectures on the subject of "<b>The Scientific Case against Random Macro Evolution</b> (and for Intelligent Design)."</i>

Darwinists make sweeping statements bout probability without any statistical mathematical support...
</p>
Darwinists assert life began spontaneously by natural processes They claim time is a central feature in the drama of first life. Darwinists insist given enough time, an unknown process may bring first life into existence. They are therefore characterized by an unquenchable optimism that given enough time anything is possible. Darwinists make sweeping statements bout probability without any statistical mathematical support. I will demonstrate below the necessary time was not available because the fossil evidence now shows single celled life began almost immediately and all the phyla were "created" in a 5 to 10 million year period during the Cambrian Explosion. According to Darwinism, change this fast is impossible because the extreme rarity of useful mutations would require a massive amount of time.
<br><br>
It is a mathematical precept that if the odds against an event occurring are greater than one in 10<sup>50</sup>, it cannot be proposed as a scientific theory because it is statistically impossible. According to mathematician Lee M Spetner, writing in his book "<u>Not by Chance! Shattering the Modern Theory of Evolution</u>":
<br><br>
<li style="list-style-type:bullet">
Typical bacterium has 2000 different enzymes. To compute the odds of randomly assembling a Backterium from all the right enzymes, you take the probability of assembling one-enzyme times itself 2000 times.
</li>
<li style="list-style-type:bullet">
The result: there is a 1 in a <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4,000th</sub> chance a single bacterium ever evolved on earth after a billion years of trials and assuming th available enzyme stew (for which there is no evidence.)
</li>
<br>
<p class="flootie">
these odds made up such an outrageously small probability it could not be faced even if the whole universe consisted of organic soup...
</p>
In 1981, Nobel laureate Sir Fred Hoyle and his associate Dr. Chandra Wickramasinghe calculated that these odds ade up such an outageously small probability it could not be faced even if the whole universe consisted of organic soup. "Evolution from Space" (1981)
<br><br>
Hoyle added, "...it was more likely (for just one bacterium to self-generate) that a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein. "To get a cell by chance would require at least 100 functional proteins to appear simultaneously in one place. That is 100 simultaneous events each with an independent probability of one in 10/20th. 10/20 X 100 equals an overall probability of one in 10/2000th.
