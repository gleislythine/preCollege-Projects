An excerpt from "Boothworld Industries Initiation Kit"

<p>
"Welcome to Boothworld Industries. My name is Samantha and I will be your operator today. Name?"
<br>
I didn't know what to say so I told the operator my name.
<br>
"Sir, we know who you are. I'm your operator. Please give me a name to access."
<br>
"I don't understand," I said.
<br>
"It can be anyone, sir. We just need a name."
<br>
"Uh, okay," I said. I made up a name. "Harold Withers."
<br>
"Sir, as your operator, I must point out that fictitious names, or the names of people that you don't know, cannot be used."
<br>
"Used for what?" I asked. How had she known that I'd made up that name? The whole thing felt like it was some sort of prank, but hardly anyone knew my new phone number.
<br>
"Remodeling."
<br>
"Remodeling? Is this the plumber?" I asked.
<br>
"Welcome to Boothworld Industries. My name is Samantha and I will be your operator today. Name?"
<br>
I took that as a yes and gave them the name of an old ex-girlfriend. "Jessica Goodwin."
<br>
I could hear the clicking of a keyboard on the other end of the phone. It sounded like the woman was pounding the thing with her fists. After a few moments of this, she returned.
<br>
"Jessica Goodwin," she said. "Remodeling is scheduled for August 21, 2015. Would you like to reschedule?"
<br>
I was silent on my side of the phone. I couldn't believe this. Someone had to be playing a prank on me.
<br>
"Who is this? Is this you, Jessica? Are you playing a prank on me?" I asked.
<br>
The woman didn't respond for a long time. I thought that whoever was on the other end of the phone was holding in a laugh.
<br>
"Hello?" I asked.
<br>
"Yes or no, Sir?" The woman asked back.
<br>
"Yes?" I said, not understanding what the woman was asking.
<br>
"I have a Tuesday appointment available. Will that work?"
<br>
At this point I thought I was going insane and that it actually was the plumbing company.
<br>
"What about today?" I asked. "Do you have anything available for today?"
<br>
"Normally we can't arrange for a reschedule on such short notice, but today we had a cancellation. How does three o'clock work for you?"
<br>
"Three o'clock is fine," I said.
<br>
"Three o'clock it is then. Would you like a courtesy call?"
<br>
"Sure."
<br>
"Wonderful. We at Boothworld Industries say thanks and welcome to the club. You have a marvelous day."
