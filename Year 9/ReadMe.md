# Year 9 Portfolio
Language taught: HTML/CSS and JavaScript

When I took this course, my teacher had a website and all of the lessons and activities were there.

[Click here](https://www.nasuli.com/) for my teacher's course website.

This course's entirety is very restricted, so pardon me for how it looks like.
I copied the exact style of how my teacher has done it.
